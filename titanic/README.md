# This contains an analysis of the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is meant for supervised machine learning.

We'll try to answer the following questions:

Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (age, gender, class.. etc)
What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
Where did the passengers come from?
Who was alone and who was with family?
What factors helped someone survive the sinking?

### Also using logistic Regression i'll build a model for it
